            <h2>For Users:</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to <i>SentimentAnalyzer</i>, a web-based tool hooked directly up to
                the Twitter API to bring you what people are thinking, right now.

                Give SentimentAnalyzer a topic – preferably a polarizing one – and it
                will display, in real time, the percentage of tweets coming in that are
                saying <b>good things</b> about that topics versus those that are saying
                <b>bad things</b> about it.
            </p>

                The web server was created using express and
                <a href="https://socket.io/docs/v4/">socket.io,</a>
                an npm package that uses WebSocket protocol as opposed to
                traditional HTTP.
                This enables two-way, realtime communuication betwee the client
                and server. Since Kafka and the Twitter API also used WebSocket,
                there is essentially realtime communication between all 4 components.
                <br><br>
                
                Tweets are classified as <i>Positive</i> or <i>Negative</i> using
                the Naive Bayes Classifier from the
                <a href="https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/classify/naivebayes.html">nltk</a>
                package in python.
                <br><br>

                Raw text data is streamed from the Twitter API to a Kafka topic
                and then fed to the classifier. The classifications are then streamed
                to a separate kafka topic, which forwards them to the server
                and eventually the client.
                <br><br>

                When the server is started, two sets of Kafka Producers and Consumers
                are initialized: one in python, and one in node.js. We shall refer to
                the former set as P.consumer, P.producer and the latter set as
                N.consumer, N.producer ("P" for python and "N" for node).
                <br><br>

                Upon server start, most of the pipline is set up. N.producer,
                P.consumer and P.producer connect to the broker. N.producer is
                ready to receive data from Twitter and send it to the "raw" topic,
                P.consumer is ready to receive that data and feed it to the classifier,
                and P.producer is ready to send the transformed data to the
                "processed" topic.
                <br><br>

                When the user clicks <i>Start Stream</i>, an event is emitted from
                the client to the server that tells the server to create a connection
                with the Twitter API. N.Consumer connects to the broker and awaits data
                from "processed" topic, completing the pipeline. Once the Twitter stream
                is initiated, data begins to flow:
                <br><br>

                Twitter API <i class='fas fa-arrow-right'></i>
                "Raw" (via N.producer) <i class='fas fa-arrow-right'></i>
                BayesClassifier (via P.consumer) <i class='fas fa-arrow-right'></i>
                "Processed" (via. P.producer) <i class='fas fa-arrow-right'></i>
                Server (via N.consumer) <i class='fas fa-arrow-right'></i>
                Client (via socket.io)
                <br><br>
                
                Once the transformed data is received by the server, the server emits
                a different WebSocket event to all connected clients. This events
                notifies the client(s) that data has been recevied and forwards
                that data along to them. The client(s) then inject that data into
                the html. The relative percentages of positive and negative tweets
                are displayed in a donut chart created using the
                <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/doughnut.html">ChartJS</a>
                npm package.
